## Power Management Daemon

This repository includes utilities I built to perform experiments for [Per-application power delivery published in Eurosys 2019](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift/papers/eurosys19-power.pdf).

The code for ryzen platforms (tested on a Ryzen 7 1700x) can be found in the master branch

The code for Intel platforms ca be found in the skylake branch (tested on Intel Skylake-SP silver processors avilable on cloudlab)
